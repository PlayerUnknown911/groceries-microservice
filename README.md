# Grocery List Frontend

## Project Overview
This project is a **frontend web application** designed for users to create a grocery list. The simple interface allows users to input grocery items and plan their shopping effectively. The project focuses on a static design using **HTML and CSS**, providing a clean and user-friendly interface that can be enhanced with JavaScript for dynamic functionality in the future.

## Features
- **User Input Field**:
  - A single input field for entering grocery items.
- **Add Button**:
  - A button to add the entered item to the list (static functionality for now).
- **Modern Design**:
  - Clean layout with a green theme to represent freshness.
  - Hover effects on buttons for better user experience.
- **Responsive Layout**:
  - Works on various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For creating the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling the page with a modern and visually appealing design.

## Usage
1. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
2. Enter a grocery item in the text box.
3. Click the "Add" button (currently static; JavaScript functionality is needed for actual interactivity).

## Future Enhancements
- **JavaScript Integration**:
  - Enable the "Add" button to dynamically add items to a visible list.
  - Allow users to remove or edit items in the list.
- **Backend Connectivity**:
  - Save and retrieve grocery items from a database for persistent storage.
- **Mobile Optimization**:
  - Further refine the design for enhanced usability on smaller devices.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Interact with the interface to explore its static design.

## Acknowledgments
This project is a simple, static implementation of a grocery list app and serves as a base for further development into a fully functional web application.
